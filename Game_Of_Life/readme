In this code:

initialize_grid initializes a random grid of a given size (rows x cols).
update_grid updates the grid based on the Game of Life rules:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
animate_game_of_life animates the Game of Life using matplotlib.animation.
To run this code, you'll need to install numpy and matplotlib:

pip install numpy matplotlib
